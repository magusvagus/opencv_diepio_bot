# Work in progress

A simple Bot for the browser game diep.io in Python with the OpenCV library.


## Development stages

This is a personal hobby project to learn more about python and
automation, if everything goes well several stages are planned during
development.

1. Boilerplate and a basic framework (currently in development)
    - Basic image recognition
    - Simple movement and aiming
    - Interaction with other objects/ player
    - automated upgrading and leveling

2. Fine tuning of basic functions
    - Full dynamic image recognition
    - Advanced movements
    - Polished aiming

3. Simple terminal UI using python curses

4. Performance tweaks
