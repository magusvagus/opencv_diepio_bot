# Work In Progress

A simple Bot for the browser game diep.io, using Python with the OpenCV computer vision library.


## Development Stages

This is a personal hobby project to learn more about python and
automation, if everything goes well several stages are planned during
development of this tool.

1. Boilerplate and a basic framework (currently in development)
- Basic image recognition
- Simple movement and aiming
- Interaction with other objects/ players
- automated upgrading and leveling

2. Fine tuning of basic functions
- Full dynamic image recognition
- Advanced movements
- Polished aiming

3. Simple terminal UI using python curses

4. Performance tweaks
